Consequences of Industrialization
Industrialization is the social and economic transformation of a society from an agricultural economy to an industrial one.
Although new methods and machinery simplified work and increased production, industrialization also introduced new problems. Some of the drawbacks include air and water pollution and soil pollution resulting in a significant decline in quality of life and life expectancy. Industrialization also increased the separation of labor and capital.

PhysicalEnvironmental

A negative byproduct of industrialization is environmental pollution which can adversely affect human health. When companies do not pay for environmental damages, or when these damages are not included in pricing, it is considered a negative externality. Cost burdens are placed on human society in the form of deforestation, species extinction, widespread pollution, excessive waste and other forms of environmental degradation.

Social

Industrialization usually leads to migration of workers to cities, automation and repetitive tasks. Due to these factors, factory workers lose their individuality, job satisfaction is limited and they feel isolated. Health problems can also be caused by hazardous working conditions or by factors inherent in working conditions, such as noise and dirt.

Rapid urbanization brought about by industrialization generally leads to a general deterioration of the quality of life of workers and many other problems for society, such as crime, stress and psychological disorders. Working long hours usually results in poor nutrition and consumption of quick and low quality foods, resulting in an increased incidence of diseases such as diabetes, heart attacks and strokes. 

Financial

The division of labor and capital as a result of industrialization leads to a wide gap between the rich and the poor. Those who have capital tend to accumulate excessive profits derived from their economic activities, resulting in greater inequality of income and wealth.
